I was a member of a four person team on this Live Project for The Tech Academy. I participated in daily stand-ups during our sprint session to contribute to the ScheduleIt project -- an ASP.NET MVC user management system thatâ€™s managed under the SCRUM methodology and utilizes TFS Version Control. The system tracks clock-ins, schedules,and requests for time off among other related tasks. 

This repository contains snippets of code that I worked on throughout the sprint
